## convert_msa.csv
CSV file that contains pre-2013 Metropolitan Statistical Areas and the (mostly) corresponding post-2013 MSAs. Some were converted from Metro to Micropolitan Statistical Areas, so they have empty values. Some were converted from Micro to Metro. Those are **not** in
this list. Note that the borders of MSAs change, so these should only be
considered rough correspondences.
